# TODO — code-excerpt-pdf

Task list for `docs/tasks/plan.md`. Work top to bottom; slices are ordered by dependency. Every slice
must end green on `npm run test && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build`.

Legend: **[!]** blocks later work · **[ext]** human/external action with lead time

---

## Setup — minimum shared groundwork

- [ ] `npm i pdfkit` + `npm i -D @types/pdfkit`
- [ ] Add `postinstall` that copies `node_modules/pdfkit/js/pdfkit.standalone.js` →
      `public/vendor/` (keeps the version pinned)
- [ ] `npm i -D vitest vite-tsconfig-paths`; add `vitest.config.ts` (env `node`, no jsdom) and
      `test` / `test:watch` scripts - [ ] **Verify `@/*` resolves in a test** — Vitest ignores `tsconfig.json` `paths` and fails
      silently without `vite-tsconfig-paths`
- [ ] `app/globals.css` — add `--font-mono: var(--font-mono);` to `@theme inline` (currently
      missing, so `font-mono` does not resolve to Geist Mono)
- [ ] `.gitignore` — add `!.env.example` (the `.env*` line would swallow it)
- [ ] `package.json` — change `format` to `prettier --write .`
- [ ] Clean up `app/layout.tsx`: remove the unused `Geist` import and the stray semicolon on the
      `cn` import

---

## Slice 0 — pdfkit + font + page-model spike **[!]**

Throwaway UI; timebox 1 day. Highest-value spike — everything downstream assumes it passes.

- [ ] Rename `generate.js` → `generate.cjs` (it currently throws `ReferenceError: require is not
defined` under `"type": "module"`) and update `.claude/ARCHITECTURE.md` in the same commit
- [ ] Run `node generate.cjs <fixture-dir>` and keep the output as the geometry reference
- [ ] Choose + subset a Unicode monospace font (regular + bold, Cyrillic coverage)
- [ ] Throwaway page + Web Worker loading `pdfkit.standalone.js` from `/public/vendor/`
- [ ] Collect chunks via `doc.on("data", …)` → `new Blob(...)`; **do not add `blob-stream`** (it
      pulls a Node stream shim Turbopack will not polyfill)

Acceptance:

- [ ] Worker runs under **both** `npm run dev` and `npm run build && npm run start`, with
      `next.config.ts` still empty
- [ ] Embedded font renders Latin **and** Cyrillic; `heightOfString` returns non-zero width for
      Cyrillic
- [ ] `heightOfString(...) / lineAdvance` is an integer across ~30 real files: long lines, one
      5,000-char minified line, CRLF, tabs, no trailing newline, Cyrillic comments
- [ ] Arithmetic paginator equals `doc.bufferedPageRange().count` for a ~10,000-line selection
      (if off by ±1, identify the `lineGap` asymmetry vs the orphan guard **before** building UI)
- [ ] Geometry matches `generate.cjs` (margins, sizes, spacing, flow)
- [ ] `npm run build` — route First Load JS does **not** grow by ~1 MB; DevTools shows the pdfkit
      asset fetched only on first export

- [x] ~~Amend `docs/SPEC.md`~~ — **done ahead of slice 0**; see `docs/tasks/plan.md` § "SPEC
      amendments"

> **If the worker or the paginator fails → STOP.** Fallback is a server-side render route, which
> reorders the whole plan. Raise it before continuing.

---

## Slice 1 — Anonymous flat export

- [ ] `lib/pdf/constants.ts` — the entire visual contract in one file (changing it is ask-first
      per SPEC §6; one file makes that diff obvious)
- [ ] `lib/pdf/measure.ts`, `lib/pdf/render.ts` + tests
- [ ] `lib/uniqueness/hash.ts` + test — SHA-256 via `crypto.subtle` - [ ] **Hash raw bytes, before** the `\t` → two-space transform, and comment why (hashing
      post-transform invalidates every stored hash on any future whitespace tweak)
- [ ] `renderPdf()` returns `{ blob, pageCount, files[] }` from a **single** run — `actualPages`
      must never come from a second render
- [ ] `components/local/file-drop.tsx`, `components/pdf/download-button.tsx`,
      `app/(app)/local/page.tsx`

Acceptance:

- [ ] N files → one PDF, alphabetical, continuous flow, no page numbers
- [ ] Running total equals the downloaded PDF's real page count **exactly**
- [ ] Binary files rejected with a visible reason
- [ ] `pageCount` deterministic across runs for a fixed fixture
- [ ] Zero network requests fire on export (check DevTools)

---

## Slice 2 — Anonymous folder tree

- [ ] `lib/tree/types.ts` — `FileEntry`, `ContentSource` (the seam that makes GitHub a swap of one
      implementation in slice 5)
- [ ] `lib/tree/build.ts`, `lib/tree/selection.ts`, `lib/sources/local.ts` + tests
- [ ] `lib/pdf/estimate.ts` + calibration test against the dropped folder as corpus
- [ ] `npx shadcn@latest add checkbox collapsible badge scroll-area` (base-ui `Checkbox` has a
      native `indeterminate` prop — that is the tri-state)
- [ ] `components/tree/{tree-view,tree-node,tree-toolbar,page-total}.tsx`
- [ ] Folder upload via `webkitdirectory`
- [ ] **Render estimate _and_ exact side by side** (estimate in a dev-only column) — otherwise the
      byte estimator ships to slice 5 uncalibrated

Acceptance:

- [ ] Correct nested tree; folder nodes show aggregate estimate + available-vs-total counts
- [ ] Tri-state checkbox: none / partial / all
- [ ] Folder select reports "added N, skipped X used, Y vendored"
- [ ] Running total updates on every toggle
- [ ] **No target input field exists anywhere in the UI**
- [ ] Estimator never under-estimates by more than one page across the corpus

---

## Slice 3 — Vendored detection

- [ ] `lib/vendored/index.ts` (precedence resolver), `gitattributes.ts`, `plugins/shadcn.ts`,
      `structural.ts` + tests
- [ ] Tree markers, toolbar show/hide toggle, warn-on-add dialog
- [ ] Overrides in React state (persistence is slice 8)

Acceptance:

- [ ] Precedence: manual > `.gitattributes` > shadcn plugin > structural list
- [ ] Folder rules cascade to descendants **including files added later**; file beats folder
- [ ] Adding a vendored file **warns and proceeds** — never hard-blocks
- [ ] Hidden by default, with a show toggle
- [ ] Drop **this repo**: `components/ui/button.tsx` is flagged via `components.json` →
      `aliases.ui`, and unmarking it sticks

---

## ▸ CHECKPOINT A — full UX, zero infrastructure

- [ ] Review the whole experience on a real repo before any account or database exists
- [ ] **[ext]** Register the GitHub App: `Contents: Read-only`, callback URL, **separate Setup
      URL**, "Request user authorization during installation" **unchecked**, "Expire user
      authorization tokens" **on**. Record client ID, secret, app slug
- [ ] **[ext]** Create the Neon project; capture **both** the pooled and direct connection strings

---

## Slice 4 — Sign in with the GitHub App **[!]**

Riskiest infra slice; keep it alone. Budget a 1-day spike inside it, against a real deploy.

- [ ] `auth.ts` (Auth.js v5, JWT strategy, **no adapter**), `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- [ ] **Override provider scope to `""`** — the default is `read:user user:email`, and a GitHub App
      ignores scopes entirely
- [ ] Handle the private-email case: either grant account-level _Email addresses: Read_ or supply a
      `profile()` tolerating a null email (otherwise it passes your test and fails in production)
- [ ] `app/api/github/setup/route.ts` — dedicated Setup URL, **idempotent** (repo-selection changes
      return through it too)
- [ ] `app/api/github/refresh/route.ts` — the **only** place refresh happens; in-flight promise map
      so parallel blob fetches cannot trigger parallel refreshes
- [ ] `jwt` callback does **no network I/O** — it only sets `token.error = "expired"`
- [ ] Track `refresh_token_expires_in` (6 months) → clean re-auth, not a 500
- [ ] `lib/github/installation.ts` (`GET /user/installations` → `total_count === 0`)
- [ ] `app/(app)/layout.tsx`, `app/(app)/projects/page.tsx`, `.env.example`

Acceptance:

- [ ] Sign-in reaches only the repos selected at install
- [ ] Authenticated-but-no-installation routes to the install URL, and the return lands on a
      **working** page (not a CSRF error)
- [ ] Session survives refresh; expired token refreshes transparently under **5 concurrent**
      requests
- [ ] `grep -rn "repo" auth.ts` finds no scope
- [ ] No token in any log or RSC payload
- [ ] **Tested on a Vercel preview, not localhost** — in-process locks stop helping across lambdas

## ▸ CHECKPOINT B — auth security review

- [ ] Dedicated manual pass (SPEC §5 accepts no e2e coverage here). Revoke on GitHub, refresh,
      confirm graceful handling. Grep the build output for the client secret

---

## Slice 5 — GitHub repos end to end (still no persistence)

- [ ] `lib/github/{client,tree,blob,errors,concurrency}.ts`
- [ ] `app/api/github/{tree,blob}/route.ts` — **all GitHub access lives here, never in RSC**
- [ ] Zod schemas for the Trees response (first untrusted JSON)
- [ ] React Query provider; `lib/sources/github.ts` implementing `ContentSource`
- [ ] `app/(app)/projects/[repoId]/page.tsx`

Acceptance:

- [ ] Opening a repo issues exactly **one** `recursive=1` Trees call
- [ ] Navigating away and back in-session issues **zero** further GitHub calls
- [ ] Content fetched only for selected files; concurrency capped 3–5
- [ ] Truncated tree (large monorepo) surfaced honestly, not silently dropped
- [ ] Export uses the identical pipeline to anonymous mode

## ▸ CHECKPOINT C — API budget review

- [ ] Confirm call counts in a real network trace before persistence obscures them; check headroom
      against 5000/hr

---

## Slice 6 — Uniqueness (migration 1)

- [ ] `prisma/schema.prisma` — **only** `User`, `Repo`, `Export`, `UsedFile`
- [ ] `prisma.config.ts` (`datasource.url` moved here); generator `prisma-client` with
      `output = "../lib/db/generated"`
- [ ] `lib/db/client.ts` — `PrismaNeon` adapter + `globalThis` singleton
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` (pooled, runtime) **and** `DIRECT_URL` (unpooled, migrations)
- [ ] `"postinstall": "prisma generate"`
- [ ] Resolve empirically whether `serverExternalPackages` / a Turbopack alias is needed for the
      custom output path — **record the answer in `next.config.ts` with a comment**
- [ ] Upsert `User` from the `signIn` callback (no `@auth/prisma-adapter` — no Prisma 7 support)
- [ ] `app/api/exports/route.ts`, `lib/uniqueness/status.ts` + test

Acceptance:

- [ ] Export persists one `UsedFile` per file with `commitSha`, `contentHash`, `sizeBytes`
- [ ] Used files marked on next load; same path + new hash → `used-but-changed`
- [ ] A used file can never silently re-enter a listing
- [ ] Per-project stats compute with **no** extra GitHub call

## ▸ CHECKPOINT D — NDA review of migration 1

- [ ] `pg_dump` and grep for source code and anything credential-shaped

---

## Slices 7–11

- [ ] **7 — Exports history + regeneration.** Re-fetch pinned SHAs; show original vs current page
      count **informationally** (never as a gate); graceful `source-gone` pointing to the emailed
      copy
- [ ] **8 — Persisted classifications (migration 2).** Overrides survive refresh. NDA review
- [ ] **9 — Neon `TreeCache` tier (migration 3).** Head-SHA invalidation, manual Refresh, TTL
      backstop. Pure optimization — no acceptance criterion depends on it. NDA review
- [ ] **10 — Settings + GDPR.** Repo-access link out to GitHub, full data export, account deletion.
      **Must be last** — it enumerates the final schema
- [ ] **11 — Marketing.** `app/(marketing)/` landing, ToS, privacy. Parallelizable from slice 4 on

## ▸ CHECKPOINT E — pre-launch

- [ ] `pg_dump` inspection against the final schema
- [ ] Exercise GDPR export **and** delete on a real account
- [ ] ToS and privacy live
- [ ] Rate-limit behaviour verified on a large repo
- [ ] Only then: put the public-instance link in the repo description
